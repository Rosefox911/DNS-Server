Documentation
The main issue we had originally was getting the structures to be compield and seen by GCC correctly. We resolved this after Professor Mislove explained it in class. 
After that, we had trouble finding out how to allocate the structure into the buffer, we did this by having a pointer to the structure, and then casting it as a structure and saving it to the buffer.
Of course, handling compression was a pain as well. We resolved this by looking for pointers, and having a specific function in case there were pointers. 
A problem we faced was with the size of the structures. If we had to redo this project again we would  have uses memcpy. 
The structure size became a problem when matcghing up to the specifications of the project. We ended up using shorts for  most of it. 
The sending part wasn't TOO hard, recieving was much harder. It became a problem when compression was present and of course, when we had to match the specific size.
Our approach was to do multipel print statements all over the program and go from there. We implemented everything piece by piece and just stayed focus on a specific thing. 
Finding the strtok command was amazing. Our program supports any and all ports thanks to this awesome command!
As with any C program, segmentation faults were a pain. But GDB with "bt" (backtrace) was SUPER helpful.
